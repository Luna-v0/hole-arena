# Hole Card Game Rules

## Objective

The main goal in Hole is to score points by creating combinations of cards, called melds. The game is typically played in pairs (4 players) or head-to-head (2 players). The team or player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

## Setup

- **Cards:** The game uses two standard 52-card decks plus four jokers, for a total of 108 cards.
- **Dealing:** Each player is dealt 11 cards.
- **Pots (or Pozzetti):** Two separate piles of 11 cards each, called "pots," are set aside. These are for players who run out of their initial hand.
- **Draw & Discard Piles:** The remaining cards form the draw pile (face-down), and the top card is turned over to start the discard pile (face-up).

## Gameplay

Players take turns in a clockwise direction. A turn consists of the following actions:

1.  **Draw:** A player must either:
    *   Draw the top card from the draw pile.
    *   Pick up the *entire* discard pile.

2.  **Meld (Optional):** The player can then lay down new melds or add cards to their team's existing melds.

3.  **Discard:** The player's turn ends when they discard one card to the discard pile.

## Melds

Melds are combinations of three or more cards of the same suit in sequential order (e.g., 4, 5, 6 of hearts).

### Wild Cards

- Jokers and 2s are wild cards and can be used as a substitute for any card in a meld.
- A meld containing a wild card is called a **"Dirty" meld** (or *sporco*).
- A meld with no wild cards is a **"Clean" meld** (or *pulito*).

## Hole

A meld that consists of seven or more cards is called a **Hole**. Holes give bonus points and are essential for ending the game.

- **Clean Hole:** A Hole with no wild cards. It is worth 200 points.
- **Dirty Hole:** A Hole that includes a wild card. It is worth 100 points.

## Taking the Pot

- When a player runs out of cards from their initial hand (by melding or discarding their last card), they take one of the 11-card pots.
- Each team can only take one pot per round.

## Ending the Round (Closing)

To end, or "close," a round, a player's team must meet these conditions:

1.  They must have already taken their pot.
2.  They must have created at least one Hole.
3.  A player must get rid of all the cards in their hand, ending by discarding a final card. This final discard cannot be a wild card.

## Scoring

Points are awarded based on the cards in a team's melds, as well as for Holes and other bonuses.

### Card Values

- **Joker:** 30 points
- **2 (wild card):** 20 points
- **Ace:** 15 points
- **K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8:** 10 points
- **7, 6, 5, 4, 3:** 5 points

### Bonus Points

- **Clean Hole:** 200 points
- **Dirty Hole:** 100 points
- **Going out (Closing):** 100 points

At the end of the round, the value of all cards in each team's melds are added to their score, along with any bonus points. The value of any cards left in a player's hand is subtracted from their team's score.
