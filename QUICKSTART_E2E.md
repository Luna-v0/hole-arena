# Quick Start: E2E Bot Game Test

This guide will help you run the end-to-end test for a complete bot game in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Python 3.10+ with backend dependencies installed

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Install Dependencies (First Time Only)

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

### 2. Run the Test

Choose one of these options:

#### Option A: Default (Headless)
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Option B: Watch the Browser
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

#### Option C: Interactive UI Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

#### Option D: Using the Helper Script
```bash
./run-e2e-tests.sh
```

### 3. View Results

After the test completes:

```bash
# Open the HTML report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Screenshots are saved in `test-results/` directory.

## What the Test Does

1. ‚úÖ Starts frontend (React + Vite) on port 5173
2. ‚úÖ Starts backend (FastAPI) on port 8000
3. ‚úÖ Opens browser and navigates to home page
4. ‚úÖ Clicks "4 Bots (Random)" button
5. ‚úÖ Waits for game to auto-start
6. ‚úÖ Monitors game progress every second
7. ‚úÖ Detects game completion
8. ‚úÖ Validates game ended successfully
9. ‚úÖ Captures final screenshot
10. ‚úÖ Generates test report

## Expected Output

```
üéÆ Starting 4-bot game test...
‚úì Home page loaded
‚úì Clicked "4 Bots (Random)" button
‚úì Navigated to game page
‚è≥ Waiting for game to start...
‚úì Game has started
‚è≥ Monitoring game progress...
‚è≥ Still playing... (iteration 10/500)
‚è≥ Still playing... (iteration 20/500)
...
‚úì Game over detected at iteration 124
‚úì Game completed successfully
üìä Game completed in 124 iterations (~124 seconds)
‚úì Final screenshot saved
```

## Duration

- **Quick page load test**: ~10 seconds
- **2-bot game**: ~2-5 minutes
- **4-bot game**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Full test suite**: ~10-15 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Backend fails to start

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend fails to start

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Tests timeout

This is normal for the first run or if the game logic is slow. The test will:
- Wait up to 5 minutes for game completion
- Check game state every second
- Capture a screenshot if timeout occurs

### Port already in use

Stop any services running on ports 5173 or 8000:

```bash
# Find and kill process on port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Find and kill process on port 8000
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

## Running Specific Tests

### Only the 4-bot game test:
```bash
npx playwright test -g "4-bot"
```

### Only the 2-bot game test:
```bash
npx playwright test -g "2-bot"
```

### Only the quick verification:
```bash
npx playwright test -g "page loads"
```

## Debugging

### See what's happening:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Step through the test:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Interactive mode:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Next Steps

Once the test passes:

1. ‚úÖ Your full stack is working correctly
2. ‚úÖ Bot game logic is functioning
3. ‚úÖ WebSocket communication is operational
4. ‚úÖ Frontend-backend integration is solid

You can now:

- Add more test cases in `e2e/` directory
- Customize test behavior in `e2e/bot-game.spec.ts`
- Configure Playwright in `playwright.config.ts`
- Read full documentation in `E2E_TESTING.md`

## Help

- **Full documentation**: See [E2E_TESTING.md](./E2E_TESTING.md)
- **Test details**: See [e2e/README.md](./e2e/README.md)
- **Setup summary**: See [E2E_SETUP_SUMMARY.md](./E2E_SETUP_SUMMARY.md)

## Success!

If the test passes, you'll see:

```
‚úì 1 passed (2m 34s)
```

And you can view the HTML report with screenshots showing the complete game!
